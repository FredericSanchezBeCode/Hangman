## The mission

You have to make a website version of the [hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) word game. To do so
try to think the *structure*, the *backend* (functionality) and the *frontend*
(design) of your project before you start coding.

**At the very least your version of the *hangman* should:**

- propose an hidden word V
- allow the selection of letters  V
- verify if a selected letter belongs to the word  V
- count the number of failure (lives)  V
- check if it's a *game over*  V
- check if the word as been found  V

**Optionally it can**:

- keep in memory all guessed letters  V
- only let the player guess a letter once  V

**Bonus**:

- use canvas

NOTE: The instructions below are meant to guide you not impose a way of doing
things, what matters is the end result.

**Instructions**:

* create the repository
* think the project through
* write the backend (make it functional)
* write the frontend (make it pretty)
* implement both parts into a web page
